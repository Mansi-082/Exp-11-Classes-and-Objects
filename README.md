# Experiment 11
## Program 1
### Aim: 
Swap the numbers using call by value
### Software used: 
Visual Studio Code
### Theory:
In the call-by-value mechanism, when a function is called, a copy of the actual arguments is passed to the function. The function works with these copies, and any modifications to the parameters inside the function do not affect the original variables outside the function. Call by value is simple and safe, as it prevents accidental changes to the original data, but it can be inefficient when passing large data structures.
### Output:
![output]()
### Conclusion:
We learned about the call by value operation in C++. 

## Program 2
### Aim: 
Swap the numbers using call by reference. 
### Software used: 
Visual Studio Code
### Theory:
In the call-by-reference mechanism, instead of passing a copy of the arguments, the function receives references (or pointers) to the original variables. Any changes made to the parameters inside the function will directly affect the original variables. This method is more efficient for large data structures and allows functions to modify the caller's variables, but it requires caution to avoid unintended side effects.
### Output:
![output]()
### Conclusion:
We learned about the call by reference in C++.
